The goal of this fork is to fix this
[issue](https://github.com/will-stone/browserosaurus/issues/595).

After I fixed it, the author of the project suggested
[Velja](https://sindresorhus.com/velja) which worked perfectly for me, so I'm
archiving this fork as I'm not using it anymore and maintaning a fork is a
effort that doesn't make sense any more.

# Browserosaurus

Browserosaurus is an open-source (GPLv3 license), browser prompter for macOS. It
works by setting itself as the default browser; any clicked links in non-browser
apps are now sent to Browserosaurus where you are presented with a menu of all
your installed browsers. You may now decide which app you’d like to continue
opening the link with.

## Notable Forks

Browserosaurus is primarily made for my needs and environment. Therefore, some
feature requests do not make it into the main project, but that's the beauty of
Open Source, you are free to copy the code and make your own tweaks (as long as
it remains open-sourced, of course, please see the license 😉). Here are some
forks of this project that you may like to consider:

- [Browseratops](https://github.com/riotrah/browseratops) by
  [@riotrah](https://github.com/riotrah). Browserosaurus but for **Windows**!

> Please PR your own fork to this list.
